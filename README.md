# Auto Clicker
it's a auto clicker that i create for a game, but i think that can be used for more something.
it start with "ctrl+shift+space", if you want change the hotkey its simple

![change the hokey and print](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuriGL-1/fuzzy-octo-goggles/refs/heads/main/change.png)

change the "keyboard.add_hotkey('key+key+key', comecar)", and "print("press KEY+KEY+KEY for enable/disable the auto clicker")"

# Example:
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+capslock', comecar)
print("press CTRL+SHIFT+CAPSLOCK for enable/disable the auto clicker")
